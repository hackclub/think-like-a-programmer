# Think Like a Programmer üë©üèø‚Äçüíª

Think Like a Programmer is [Hack Club]([hackclub.com](https://hackclub.com/))'s 7th [Day of Service](https://days-of-service.hackclub.dev/), an initiative started to bridge the gender gap in technology. We organized a day of coding and brainstorming in partnership with a local youth organization, [The Girl Scouts of Eastern Massachusetts](https://www.gsema.org/)!

The event took place on February 22nd, 2024. High schoolers taught girl scouts how to "think like a programmer" through identifying community problems, brainstorming solutions, and wireframing their solution! 

This repo is meant to serve as a point of reference for anyone wanting to organize their own Day of Service! See our open-source planning in the Hack Club Slack #boston-days-of-service channel!

## üéØ The Goal
We came into this weekend with 2 goals:
1. To support Hack Clubbers to become more technical, to become better leaders, and to deepen friendships through collaborative coding projects.
2. To grow Hack Club‚Äôs community so it is inclusive and accessible to teenagers of all backgrounds. We made active outreach to under-represented, less-advantaged young people, including girls and girls of color, who don‚Äôt have computer science programs or professional mentors in their community.

## üí∏ The Budget

Think Like a Programmer had a budget of $19,000 with an approximate breakdown of
| Item | Amount ($) |
|------|--------|
|‚úàÔ∏è Travel Stipends| 1,000 |
|üè® Hotel | 1,000 |
|ü•ò Dinner | 3,000 |
|ü•ò Weekend expenses | 250 
|üëö Hackathon: Swag, Decorations, workshops | 1,250 |

High school hackathon budgets can range anywhere from \$500 to \$75,000. Horizon was our first time organizing such event and if repeated, keeping the attendees local would be able to bring the costs down to around $5,000 or even less!

Every expense made for Horizon has been open sourced [here](https://bank.hackclub.com/think-like-a-programmer) through Hack Club Bank's [transparency mode](https://headwayapp.co/bank-changelog/transparent-finances-optional-feature-151427)
